# Tax-Calculator ðŸ¤” 
Tax season is approaching really quickly! So I created this program that will help ease the process of filling out the 1040 tax form. 

This program has adjusted tax brackets and tax rates for filing taxes that are due this coming April 2023. 

The tax brackets and tax rates were obtained from "https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/current-federal-tax-rate-schedules/L7Bjs1EAD"
