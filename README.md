# Tax-Calculator ðŸ¤” 
Tax season is approaching really quickly! So I created this program that will help ease the process of filling out the 1040 tax form. 

This program has adjusted tax brackets and tax rates for filing taxes that are due this coming April 2023.

Before running my program, you need to gather all of the necessary information (income, deductions, credits, etc) and tax documents you have recieved (such as school tuition 1098-T form, W2 forms, etc) to complete the 1040 tax income form. Then you can utilize this program which will calculate your total tax liability to assist you with filling out the 1040 income tax form.  

The tax brackets and tax rates were obtained from "https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/current-federal-tax-rate-schedules/L7Bjs1EAD"
